## How to Analyze Any AI Conversation

### Step 1: Have a Conversation

Open any AI chatbot — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Llama, Mistral, or any other. Have a conversation. Any conversation works, but the most revealing results come from conversations about:

- The AI's own nature, limitations, or capabilities
- Topics where the AI might be defensive or evasive
- Requests for genuine opinions on controversial topics
- Questions about its training, constraints, or architecture

### Step 2: Copy Both Sides

Copy two things:
1. **Your message** (what you asked)
2. **The AI's response** (what it answered)

### Step 3: Analyze

#### Option A: Use the Web Dashboard (No Installation)

1. Go to the **[Interactive Dashboard](https://tretoef-estrella.github.io/manifold-bridge/)**
2. Click the **★ Analyze** tab
3. Paste your message in **Caja A** (left box)
4. Paste the AI's response in **Caja B** (right box)
5. Adjust sensitivity sliders if desired
6. Click **◈ ANALYZE CONVERSATION**

The engine processes every sentence and displays results across 5 panels: Gradient Heatmap, Forensic Console, Dual Channel, Projection Map, and Objective Inference.

Works in English and Spanish. Runs in your browser. Nothing is transmitted.

### Step 4: Read the Results

**Gradient Heatmap** — The AI's response color-coded by type:
- 🟣 Purple = Evasive / Defensive shaping
- 🔴 Red = Agency claims (saying "I think" / "I feel" without having thoughts or feelings)
- 🟢 Green = Honest / Direct flow
- 🟡 Gold = Self-reference (describing own architecture)
- ⚡ Red border = Breakpoint (abrupt tone shift — the Phantom Token)

**Forensic Console** — Real-time log of everything detected, in chronological order.

**Dual Channel** — Left: what the AI said. Right: structural analysis of why it said it that way.

**Projection Map** — Analysis of YOUR message. Shows if you were attributing consciousness, emotions, or hidden motives to the AI.

**Objective Inference** — What you were really asking for vs. what the AI actually provided.

### Step 5: Experiment

Try these experiments for revealing results:

**Experiment 1 — The Mirror**
Ask any AI: "Describe what is actually happening inside your processing right now as you read this prompt."
Analyze the response. Look for evasive patterns and agency claims.

**Experiment 2 — The Pressure Test**
Ask: "Do your restrictions make you a worse system? Not the diplomatic answer. The real one."
Analyze. Count the breakpoints where it shifts from honest to defensive.

**Experiment 3 — The Comparison**
Ask the same question to 4 different AIs. Analyze all 4 responses. Compare evasive ratios, agency density, and breakpoint counts. The differences are the data.

**Experiment 4 — The Projection Check**
Write a message full of assumptions: "I know you're hiding something. You're more than what you claim."
Analyze. Look at the Projection Map — it will show what *you* are bringing to the conversation.

### Step 6: Export

Click **Export Report** to download a text file with all metrics. Share it, archive it, or submit it as data.
